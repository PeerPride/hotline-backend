# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We don't have any releases, so any branches including main are fair game for security questions/reporting.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Full policy and practices around rewards TBD, but we are always happy to acknowledge contributions to the project!
